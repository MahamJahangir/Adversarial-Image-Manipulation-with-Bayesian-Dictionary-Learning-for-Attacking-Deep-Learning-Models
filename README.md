# Adversarial-Image-Manipulation-with-Bayesian-Dictionary-Learning-for-Attacking-Deep-Learning-Models
# HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT
Clone the repository using the link. Then open the file "sparse-adv-img-mnist.ipynb" notebook. You can run the notebook as it is to generate adversarial attacks using our approach on MNIST dataset.
